## Goals from a week ago
(can be empty for the first week)


## Progress and Issues 
We worked on the setup of our github repository for our project as well as the completion of our living Requirements and Policies document. We learned about each other's skill sets and strengths and assigned our roles accordingly in line with our development structure. We had trouble establishing the use cases that make our product unique from those that exist already. We are currently stuck on the necessity of having the UI of our product being completed first as UI/UX is not one of our specialties. 

## Outline Plans and Goals
- Write down pseudocode - basis for what our code will look like
- Make sure everyone is comfortable with their roles
- Establish user interface design 
- Understand the language we will be using to implement for the mobile application - Rust
